CompileFlags:
  # This tells clangd to look for the compilation database relative to this file.
  # The path should be the same on both Linux and Windows relative to the project root.
  # In this case, your build directory is `out/build/developer-tools`.
  #
  # The `!compile_commands` flag tells clangd to find the file itself.
  # The `CompilationDatabaseDir` specifies the path to that directory.
  # It works on both platforms without modification.
  CompilationDatabase: "out/build/developer-tools"
